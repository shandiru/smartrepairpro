    quote: `Great service with excellent customer care - the price was very reasonable and great value for money. I have an unusual coloured car, so in advance Shane paint matched my car colour — it was a perfect match & spot on. I then had a small dent removal and respray on part of my car. Shane also sorted a couple of extra little old scuffs & door opening chips (from previous ownership) and even put right a small scuff mark on the wheel trim for free when I picked the car up. Thanks Shane for going above and beyond and doing a great job — a trustworthy tradesman who really cares about customers. I would definitely recommend and use again!`,

    quote: `I used SL Smart Repairs today for the first time following a recommendation. Shane was approachable and honest. There was minor bodywork damage to the rear passenger wing of the car. Shane fixed it immediately on the spot and declined payment, as it was a minor job. Very refreshing to see such an honest work ethic today.`,

Fast and efficient services provided; we regularly use them as a valet. Would highly recommend.`,

    quote: `We have used Shane numerous times now and always been so happy with all of the jobs he’s done for us. Our car went to the garage for a parking sensor fault and ended up being damaged in the process — we knew exactly who we wanted to put it right. Shane worked his magic, putting it back to even better than it was before. He is very professional, competitively priced (you get what you pay for with body work), and his setup lets him work in all weathers. Don’t shop around — just book in with Shane if you care about your car and want a proper professional job. I’ll never go anywhere else — the best around in my opinion. ❤️`,

Superb work — you cannot tell my bumper has been repaired — and fast turnaround too. I will certainly use again. Shane knows what he is doing, offers good advice and is a nice guy to deal with. Top service. Thanks SL smart repairs!`,
